### Scripts

These are scripts used by the pipeline tasks.  To better support abstraction
several of these scripts were copied and renamed with the prefix `release` and
are currently being used in the GPDB 5.0 release pipeline.

These modified scripts should eventually be used in the main testing pipeline
along with the generalized tasks to better simplify the pipeline codebase.
